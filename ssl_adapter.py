class SSLAdapter(HTTPAdapter):
    """
    A custom adapter for the `requests` library that allows specifying a set of SSL ciphers 
    to be used for HTTPS requests. This is useful when you need to enforce a certain level of 
    security or need to ensure compatibility with a server that requires specific ciphers.

    The SSLAdapter class inherits from `HTTPAdapter` and overrides the `init_poolmanager` method 
    to create an SSL context with a custom cipher set. This context is then used for all HTTPS 
    connections made by this adapter.

    Example usage:
        import requests

        # Create a session and attach the SSLAdapter with custom ciphers
        s = requests.Session()
        adapter = SSLAdapter()
        s.mount('https://', adapter)

        # Make a request to a server that requires specific SSL ciphers
        response = s.get('https://example.com')

    Note:
        It's important to choose ciphers that ensure a balance between compatibility and security. 
        Using outdated or weak ciphers can expose communications to vulnerabilities.
